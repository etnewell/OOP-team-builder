# OOP Team Builder

# Description
In this project I made a program which willtake user input from a CLI program, interpret which employee is needed to make a template for, request information about that employee, and to pass that information as an object in an array ofemployee objects.

I had a hard time getting the other javascript files to accept the information passed into it. I got the first files to understand the object array that was passed into the object template rendering files, like the './lib/Employee.js' or the './lib/Intern.js' files, they return the correect type of object with the correct properties on it. My app.js file does successfully take those objects and puts them in an array. In my video using it, my console even logs that each time it submits to show this. My program does also successfully call the '/lib/htmlrenderer.js' file. I checked over and over if it was the data passed in was the correct format and it was, they are all correct object arrays with the correct format and the correct spelling and correct property names. These returned obects also work properly with the getName, getEmail, getId, etc functions. I am completely at a loss for what is happening between those two files or with the recognition for the htmlrenderer.js. It has been very difficult for me to figure out exactly what is going on. I have spent over five hours on this one part of this program. I have another assignment I need to make up and one this weekend. I have decided to cut my losses and move on to the other two tasks I have. I would love feedback on what is going on here if possible, because to my eyes it should work.

Besides this there was a bit of struggle with the exporting of the classes int the js files but besides that, that's all that there really was a problem with. Fun activity in all, I enjoy object programming.
